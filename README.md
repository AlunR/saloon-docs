### Introduction

Saloon is a PHP library that offers an API integration framework like you've never seen before. It provides you with the tools needed to build and test all the API integrations your application needs. It can be easily customised with plugins, but It comes pre-configured for you so you can get to sending API requests right away. It's built on top of Guzzle, one of the most popular HTTP clients for PHP.
