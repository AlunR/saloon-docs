### Introduction

Saloon is a PHP library that offers an API integration framework like you've never seen before. It provides you with the tools needed to build and test all the API integrations your application needs. It can be easily customised with plugins, but It comes pre-configured for you so you can get to sending API requests right away. It's built on top of Guzzle, one of the most popular HTTP clients for PHP.

### Key Features

* Provides a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that standardises the way you interact with APIs
* No HTTP client configuration is required but can be completely customised if you need
* Abstract API integrations into classes to keep your code tidy and centralised
* Great for building your next PHP SDKs or package/library
* Works great within a team as it provides a standard everyone can follow
* Application/framework agnostic
* Packed full of features like request recording, request concurrency, caching, data-transfer-object support, and full Laravel support.
* Fully extendable and welcomes your own implementations
