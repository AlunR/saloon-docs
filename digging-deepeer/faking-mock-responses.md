# ðŸ¤¿ Faking / Mock Responses

{% hint style="warning" %}
This documentation is still a work in progress while Saloon v2 is in beta.
{% endhint %}

Saloon provides a way to test your PHP applications and SDKs really easily. In your tests, you will need to create an instance of `MockClient` . The MockClient accepts an array of MockResponses which when used on a request, will respond with a fake response without actually sending a real request to the web. This helps speed up tests massively and can help you test your application for different API response scenarios, like a 404 error or 500 error.

### Registering a MockClient

Request mocking starts with a `MockClient`. This class can be applied directly to a connector instance to be used across all requests, or it can be applied on a per request basis.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="All Requests (Connector)" %}
```php
<?php

use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockClient;
use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockResponse;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200),
    MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Alex'], 200),
    MockResponse::make(['error' => 'Server Unavailable'], 500),
]);

$forge = new ForgeConnector;
$forge->withMockClient($mockClient);

// Send requests like normal...
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Individual Request" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### The MockResponse class

The **MockResponse** class is used to create fake responses Saloon understands. It can accept a body, status, and headers. These properties will be populated in the fake response. The response body accepts an array for a JSON body or plain strings to simulate other responses, like XML.

```php
use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockResponse;

MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200, $headers);
```

### Basic Usage (Sequence Mocking)

Basic sequence testing allows you to define a number of fake responses. When your application uses Saloon, it will pull out the next response in the sequence, removing it too.

```php
use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockClient;
use Saloon\Http\Faking\MockResponse;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200),
    MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Alex'], 200),
    MockResponse::make(['error' => 'Server Unavailable'], 500),
]);

(new GetForgeServerRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Sam']` and status `200`
(new GetForgeServerRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Alex']` and status `200`
(new GetForgeServerRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['error' => 'Server Unavailable']` and status `500`
```

### Connector Mocking

You may also explicitly define mock responses for a particular connector that is used. Unlike sequence tests, these are kept even after the response has been sent.

```php
use Sammyjo20\Saloon\Clients\MockClient;
use Sammyjo20\Saloon\Http\MockResponse;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    ForgeConnector::class => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200),
    OtherServiceConnector::class => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Alex'], 200),
]);

(new GetForgeServerRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Sam']` and status `200`
(new GetForgeServerRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Sam']` and status `200`
(new OtherServiceRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Alex']` and status `200`
```

### Request Mocking

You may also explicitly define mock responses for a particular request that is used. Unlike sequence tests, these are kept even after the response has been sent.

```php
use Sammyjo20\Saloon\Clients\MockClient;
use Sammyjo20\Saloon\Http\MockResponse;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    GetForgeServerRequest::class => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200),
    OtherServiceRequest::class => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Alex'], 200),
]);

(new GetForgeServerRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Sam']` and status `200`
(new OtherServiceRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Alex']` and status `200`
```

### URL Mocking

You can also define fake responses for particular URL patterns. Whenever a request is made for a particular pattern, Saloon will respond to that request.

```php
use Sammyjo20\Saloon\Clients\MockClient;
use Sammyjo20\Saloon\Http\MockResponse;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    'forge.laravel.com/api/*' => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200),
    'samcarre.dev/*' => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Alex'], 200),
    'samcarre.dev/exact' => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Taylor'], 200), // Exact requests
    '*' => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Wildcard'], 200), // Any other requests
]);

(new GetForgeServerRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Sam']` and status `200`
(new OtherServiceRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Alex']` and status `200`
(new ExactRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Taylor']` and status `200`
(new WildcardServiceRequest)->send($mockClient) // Will return with `['name' => 'Wildcard']` and status `200`
```

### Adding Expectations

When using faking responses, it's important to be able to check that a specific make request was sent and with the correct data, headers, and config. Saloon provides you with various ways to add expectations to your tests.&#x20;

#### Available Expectations&#x20;

* AssertSent
* AssertNotSent
* AssertSentJson
* AssertNothingSent
* AssertSentCount

To use one of the expectations, you can simply call the method on your **Mock Client**.

```php
<?php

// ...

$response = (new GetForgeServerRequest(123456))->send($mockClient);

$mockClient->assertSent(GetForgeServerRequest::class);
```

The **AssertSent / AssertNotSent** are the two most powerful expectation methods. They can accept a Saloon request, a URL pattern or even a closure where you define if a request/response is what you expect.

```php
<?php

// ... 

$response = (new GetForgeServerRequest(123456))->send($mockClient);

$mockClient->assertSent(GetForgeServerRequest::class);

$mockClient->assertSent('/servers/*');

$mockClient->assertSent(function (SaloonRequest $request, SaloonResponse $response) {
    return $request instanceof GetForgeServerRequest::class 
    && $request->serverId === 123456;
});
```

### Mocking Exceptions

Your test may require you to mock exceptions like Guzzle's RequestException or even your own exceptions that might get thrown. To mock an exception, chain the `throw` method after you have defined your mock response.

```php
<?php

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200)->throw(new MyException('Something bad!'))
]);
 
// ...
```

If you would like to test one of the Guzzle exceptions like RequestException, it will expect you to pass in a PSR-7 request as one of the arguments. For these exceptions, provide a closure and Saloon will fulfil the closure with the PSR-7 request.

```php
<?php

use GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    MockResponse::make()->throw(fn ($guzzleRequest) => new ConnectException('Unable to connect!', $guzzleRequest))
]);
```

### Using a mock client for all requests

Sometimes you may want to use a mock client for all requests within a connector. This is especially needed for SDKs, where you need to pass data down into different methods. You can also use the `withMockClient` method on either your connector or your request, and it will mean you don't have to define it on every request's `send` method.

```php
<?php

$forgeConnector = new ForgeConnector;

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    GetForgeUserRequest::class => MockResponse::make(['name' => 'Sam'], 200),
]);

$forgeConnector->withMockClient($mockClient);

// Make as many requests as you like without having to pass in the mock client!

$forgeConnector->send(new GetForgeUserRequest);
$forgeConnector->send(new GetForgeUserRequest);
```

### Using closures for mocking

Sometimes, you may need to return a custom mock response based on the request that is currently trying to be sent. With closure/callable mocking, you can do this! Just provide an anonymous function or an invokable class when defining the mock response, and you will get access to the current request before it is converted into a mock response. This is great if you have stored fixtures based on the request and need to load the fixture data up. Yes, this will work with all of the methods above of mocking the request.

```php
<?php

$mockClient = new MockClient([
    function (SaloonRequest $request): MockResponse {
        // Write some custom logic here...
    
        return new MockResponse([...]);
    },
]);
```
