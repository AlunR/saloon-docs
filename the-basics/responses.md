# ðŸ“¡ Responses

Depending on how you sent your request (synchronous/asynchronous) you will either receive an instance of `Response` or a `PromiseInterface.`

### Handling synchronous responses

By default, Saloon will return an instance of `Saloon\Contracts\Response`. this is the default response and is used by the GuzzleSender. This response class contains many helpful methods for interacting with your HTTP response.

```php
<?php

$connector = new ForgeConnector('api-token');
$response = $connector->send(new GetServersRequest);

$body = $response->body();
$decodedBody = $response->json();
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default, Saloon will not throw an exception if a synchronous request fails. [Refer to the handling failures section for handling errors.](handling-failures.md)
{% endhint %}

### Handling asynchronous responses

When using concurrent requests/pooling or `sendAsync` , Saloon will respond with a `GuzzleHttp\Promise\PromiseInterface.` The result will be a `Response` a class described above. When the request fails, Saloon will not use the `then` method but return an instance of `RequestException`in the `otherwise` block.

```php
<?php

use Saloon\Contracts\Response;

$connector = new ForgeConnector('api-token');
$promise = $connector->sendAsync(new GetServersRequest);

$promise
    ->then(function (Response $response) {
        // Handle successful response
    })
    ->otherwise(function (RequestException|FatalRequestException $exception) {
        // Handle failed request
    });
```

### Custom responses

* You must extend the sender's response since the sender is responsible for instantiating the object
