# ðŸŒ¿ Upgrading from v1

### Introduction

There have been several changes in version two, it's recommended that you read through [what's new in v2](whats-new-in-v2.md) before starting the upgrade.

### Estimated Upgrade Time

Simple applications/Laravel integrations: \~15-30 minutes

Advanced integrations and SDKs: \~30-45 minutes

### Installation

Firstly, update your composer.json file to `^2.0.` if you are using the additional Laravel package, you should update this to `^2.0` too. After that, run `composer update`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Non-Laravel" %}
```json
"require": {
    "sammyjo20/saloon": "^2.0"
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Laravel" %}
```json
"require": {
    "sammyjo20/saloon": "^2.0",
    "sammyjo20/saloon-laravel": "^2.0"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
From version two, the minimum required PHP version is 8.1 and the minimum Laravel version is 9 (when using the additional Laravel package)
{% endhint %}

### Namespace Changes

All of Saloonâ€™s classes have a new namespace `Saloon\\` instead of `Sammyjo20\\Saloon`. This change will affect every use of Saloonâ€™s internal classes, so itâ€™s recommended to run a find-and-replace.

* Find: `use Sammyjo20\\Saloon`
* Replace: `use Saloon`

#### Laravel Namespace Changes

If you are using the Laravel helpers package for Saloon, you should also change the namespaces.

* Find: `use Sammyjo20\\SaloonLaravel`
* Replace: `use Saloon\\Laravel`

### Class Name Changes

To help make Saloon more readable and to improve the developer experience, Saloonâ€™s classes have changed names. There were a number of classes that had the name `Saloon` within, like `SaloonRequest` and `SaloonConnector.` you should find and replace these too. Please make sure that you have renamed the namespaces first.

#### Connector

* Find: `use Saloon\\Http\\SaloonConnector`
* Replace: `use Saloon\\Http\\Connector`
* Find: `extends SaloonConnector`
* Replace: `extends Connector`

#### Request

* Find: `use Saloon\\Http\\SaloonRequest`
* Replace: `use Saloon\\Http\\Request`
* Find: `extends SaloonRequest`
* Replace: `extends Request`

#### Response (if using custom responses)

* Find `use Saloon\\Http\\SaloonResponse`
* Replace: `use Saloon\\Http\\Response`
* Find: `extends SaloonResponse`
* Replace: `extends Response`

#### MockClient

* Find: `use Saloon\\Clients\\MockClient`
* Replace: `use Saloon\\Http\\Faking\\MockClient`

#### MockResponse

* Find: `use Saloon\\Http\\MockRespone`
* Replace: `use Salooon\\Http\\Faking\\MockResponse`

### Method Changes

Saloon has also had a major refactor with the methods that are used to build and interact with connectors and requests. You should carefully find and replace the given strings.

#### Connector

The connectorâ€™s base URL method has changed.

* Find: `public function defineBaseUrl(): string`
* Replace: `public function resolveBaseUrl(): string`

The connectorâ€™s properties types have changed.

* Find: `protected ?string $response`
* Replace: `protected string $response`

The method to define a custom response has changed.

* Find: `public function getResponseClass(): string`
* Replace: `public function resolveResponseClass(): string`

The `boot` methodâ€™s single argument has changed from `SaloonRequest $request` to use a `Saloon\\Http\\PendingRequest` instead.

* Find: `public function boot(SaloonRequest $request): void`
* Replace: `public function boot(PendingRequest $pendingRequest): void`

The `request` method has been removed.

The `__call` and `__callStatic` methods have been removed alongside the magic methods that build up requests. Including the `requests` property.

#### Request

The requestâ€™s method property has changed to use a new `Saloon\\Enums\\Method` Enum. Make sure to migrate to use the new Enum too. For example: `protected Method $method = Method::GET`.

* Find: `protected ?string $method`
* Replace: `protected Method $method`

The requestâ€™s define endpoint method has changed.

* Find: `protected function defineEndpoint(): string`
* Replace: `public function resolveEndpoint(): string`

The requestâ€™s properties types have changed.

* Find: `protected ?string $response`
* Replace: `protected string $response`

The method to define a custom response has changed.

* Find: `public function getResponseClass(): string`
* Replace: `public function resolveResponseClass(): string`

The `boot` methodâ€™s single argument has changed from `SaloonRequest $request` to use a `Saloon\\Http\\PendingRequest` instead.

* Find: `public function boot(SaloonRequest $request): void`
* Replace: `public function boot(PendingRequest $pendingRequest): void`

The `send`, `sendAsync`, `getConnector` and `setConnector` methods and the `connector` property has been removed from the request. Please see below to add connector support back to your request if you need it

The `getFullRequestUrl` method has been removed on the request. You can get the URL of the request with the `PendingRequest` inside of the boot method, traits and middleware.

The `__call` method has been removed from the request. Any methods that no longer exist on the request will not be proxied to the connector.

The `traitExistsOnConnector` method has been removed from the request.

#### Responses

Saloonâ€™s response has changed to be a generic-PSR compatible response. If you are extending the existing Response, you should make sure that it is still working correctly.

#### Authenticator Traits

Previously, Saloon had five traits which would throw an exception if a request or connector wasnâ€™t authenticated. The following traits have now been removed:

* RequiresBasicAuth
* RequiresDigestAuth
* RequiresTokenAuth

You should now use the generic `RequiresAuth` trait if you would still like to throw an exception

### Plugin Traits

* Now is static method
* Now accepts PendingRequest

### Connector-first design

#### Add connector support back

### Response Interceptors

### Guzzle Handlers/Middleware

* No longer add handlers on a per-request or connector basis, you must add it to the sender

### Migrating to the new headers, query and config API

### Migrating to the new request body API

* No more data() method and only added once you add a body trait

#### Migrating to body traits

### OAuth Carbon Removal

Saloon no longer uses Carbon as a dependency, so all dates returned that used to return a `CarbonInterface` now return `DateTimeImmutable`

* OAuthAuthenticator: `getExpiresAt()`
* AccessTokenAuthenticator: `getExpiresAt()`

### Removing Connector Magic Properties

### Migrating to use PendingRequest in traits
